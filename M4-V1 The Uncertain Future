さて、最後のトピックは世界のこれからについてです。
ここ数週間、私たちはこのパンデミックがどのようにして起きたのかを探ってきましたが、パンデミックは（今や）世界中に広がっています。
そして、ワクチンや治療法の開発に向けてどんな希望があるのでしょうか。これから、私たちは次に何が起こるのかを見ていきます。
それを探るために、最後のビデオ・セグメントには著名な方々が参加しています。
（国際NGO）Resolve to Save Livesの代表で、バラク・オバマ政権下で米国疾病予防管理センターの前所長、トム・フリーデン博士からお話を伺います。
その前は、ニューヨーク市保健委員会委員、世界保健機関（WHO）のインド結核プログラムの職員でした。
国連開発計画の地域局長で、国連事務次長補のルイス・フェリペ・ロペス=カルバとも話し合います。
そして、過去の社会の崩壊についての著述があるジャーナリストで、近未来の社会を想像するSF作家でもあるアナリー・ニューウィッツと一緒に未来の地図を描いていきます。
そして最後に、コロンビア大学のジャーナリズム・トラウマ・ダートセンターのブルース・シャピロ事務局長と当面あなたがすべきこと、そして健康で安全な生活を送る展望について話を伺います。
「展望」とはどこまでの期間を意味するのでしょうか？
私たちは、それがワクチンが発明され、配布されるまでの2年間だけではないことを認めなければなりません。
はっきり言って、それは私たちの人生の残りの部分を意味しているのです。
新型コロナウイルスの登場は、ご存じのように世界を変えました。
私たちは、パンデミックが家庭、経済、社会に与えた当面のダメージを修復することを望むことができます。
しかし、元の状態に戻ることを期待すべきではありません。
私たちは事態を改善できるかもしれませんが、世界が変わったことを前提に報道すべきです。
現時点の記録では、感染者が500万人を超え、WHOは1日としては最大の感染者数を報告しています。
ピークを過ぎたと言える地域は非常に少なく、ピークを過ぎたと信じられていた地域のいくつかは第2波が到来しています。


Yet we've been in this pandemic long enough, five solid months now, to have developed a bit of
familiarity with the virus and a bit of rhythm to our reporting. We are where the British Prime
Minister Winston Churchill said the allied armies were in World War II after their first solid victory:
This is not the end.
It's not even the beginning of the end,.
But it is, perhaps the end of the beginning. 
So where are our story opportunities, here at the end of the beginning? Let's talk about the near
future, and then what comes after.
Then your future: Every substantial report says that the immediate tasks are to test, trace and
isolate.
That is: Find out if people are sick, or if they show antibody evidence of recovery; trace their
contacts if they are sick; and persuade them to be confined safely, at home or in convalescent
housing, until they are no longer a danger to others.
Convalescent housing is especially important because so much Covid transmission seems to take
place in close quarters, in households or in spaces shared by several generations of a family.
I am sure you can immediately see the story opportunities here:.
Does your country or locality have enough tests? Where are the tests coming from? What is their
published rate of reliability? Is there any chance they could be counterfeit? How will your area
handle contact tracing?
There is an important nuance here for those of you who live in developing economies: Countries
where tuberculosis is extant already know how to do contact tracing, because contact tracing is
an essential part of detecting that disease. The United States and Western Europe have mostly
lost that skill, but the countries of the global south mostly retain it.
Testing and tracing are the minimal things necessary to open up economies, which the world
badly needs to do before we slide into a global economic depression. But they are at best means
of control, of reducing risk - not of making the risk go away.
Now, there are parts of our societies who have learned in the last few decades what it means to
live even to flourish in an atmosphere of uncertain risk. Primarily, that is, people living with or at
risk of acquiring HIV-AIDS.
We learned early in that pandemic that the only way to guarantee HIV-AIDS would not be passed
on was to agree to never have sex again, to never bear children again, to never take an illegal
drug again. And people were, of course, not willing to do those things.
But what people and societies were willing to do was to develop policies of harm reduction and
social mobilization: to 100% use condoms, to prevent mother-to-child transmission, to ensure
that people who use illegal drugs can do so safely.
We've also learned to live alongside the threat of dengue, of Zika, of malaria, to be continuously
protecting ourselves while continuing to live our lives. That's what life in the age of coronavirus
may turn out to be: an extended exercise in harm reduction.
That takes us into the middle term of the future. Assume that cities and businesses reopen: How
do they operate safely?
If you live in a major city like New York or Paris, how much of that city's streets will be converted
away from cars and toward the kind of public space you need to be socially distant?
If you reside in an area with a big tourism economy like the Mediterranean coast or Venice or the
Mexican coast, what will the process be for governments to that travelers back in again and get
them to follow new rules? If where you live is a place where there's a lot of solo small businesses,
or where people survive by informal pickup work, which describes a lot of Latin America and also
sub-Saharan Africa as well. How will people solicit work without breaking social distancing? How
will they participate in any kind of safety net or income restitution, if they were informal workers in
the first place? 
Once new forms of being together become more familiar - whether that is permanent social
distancing, or regular testing, or changing how shops and offices are organized or laid out, or
finding a way to greet each other that doesn't involve a handshake - we then have to look at the
far future. And here is where our ability to draw together strands of prediction and trend as
journalists will be so valuable.
Because the story opportunities in this part are the big ideas.
How much privacy will we give up in order to know where a disease is going?
Who will be allowed to own so much data about us?
Will the forces of labor rise up as they did after conflicts throughout the 19th and 20th centuries,
and probably further back and renegotiate the rules of work with business owners and
corporations?
Will we permit our governments to retreat behind nationalism in an attempt to keep us safe - or
will we recreate that burst of international sympathy and mutual commitment that created the
United Nations and the World Health Organization after the end of World War II.
There are two more things that we need to be asking about.
The first is how do we mourn what we've lost? You can look anywhere in the world and find
memorials to military battles. It is much harder to find memorials to those lost to disease. The
1918 flu, which we talked about in our first module, the worst pandemic in recorded history, has
almost no public art memorializing it: no place, no statues; no symphonies; in English, only two
slender novellas.
The most dramatic memorial to disease is probably the AIDS quilt, it's 1.3 million square feet of
fabric. It's the largest act of crowdsourced art in the world. What will be our quilt, for the lost of
COVIC-19, the people and the societies as we knew them? What acts of memory and resolve will
we undertake, so this moment is not forgotten?
The final story that we need to look forward to is this: What will our societies do if this happens
again? As a disease reporter, I am already hearing from scientists who talk about the next big one.
The really big one.
In our first module, we talked about failures to learn from past pandemics. Going forward from
this module, let us ask: What plans are being put in place, to detect the next one earlier? What
agencies are being funded? What science needs to be a priority? What weak spots did we
perceive in each of our cities and societies that made us vulnerable? What can we do as
journalists to keep those realizations in front of people's eyes, so that the lessons of Covid-19 are
acted on, and not lost?
So that's it. The end of the beginning, the immediate and far future, and what we need to look for
next as we live through this historic moment together. I wish you all so much success in
continuing to pursue what will be the story of our lifetimes.
I know you will do great work.
Stay safe
